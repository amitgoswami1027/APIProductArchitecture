# Introduction
On a typical day, Alice, a waiter at a restaurant, serves customers their orders. An example of an order they might receive is: "Alice, can I have a caffe latte with no sugar, please?" Alice would then take the order to the kitchen with the instructions in this format: "Table 10, Customer A: One caffe latte - single serving, no sugar." The chef, working in the kitchen, then prepares the order and hands it over to Alice, who serves it to the customer.

## What is an Application Programming Interface?
An application programming interface (API) is an intermediary through which two software components communicate to share data and to get useful work done. As the name implies, exchanging information is possible because of the presence of a software interface between these components. The software components can reside on the same or different machines connected through a network.

We can relate this to the restaurant analogy above in the following way:
* The customers are software applications/clients requesting a service.
* Alice, the waiter, is the API acting as the interface between the clients and the back-end services.
* The kitchen and chef are analogous to downstream services, including the serving application and the persistence layer.
